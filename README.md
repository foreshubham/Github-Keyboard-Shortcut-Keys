## About keyboard shortcuts
Typing ? on GitHub brings up a dialog box that lists the keyboard shortcuts available for that page. You can use these keyboard shortcuts to perform actions across the site without using your mouse to navigate.

You can disable character key shortcuts, while still allowing shortcuts that use modifier keys, in your accessibility settings. For more information, see "Managing accessibility settings."

The GitHub Command Palette also gives you quick access to a wide range of actions, without the need to remember keyboard shortcuts. For more information, see "GitHub Command Palette."
